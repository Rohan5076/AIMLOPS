It introduces the latest trends in natural language\\nprocessing (NLP), primarily large language models (LLMs), providing\\ninsights into how these networks work. Additionally, it includes projects that\\ndemonstrate the application of these models in creating retrieval-augmented\\ngeneration (RAG) pipelines. These concepts represent cutting-edge\\ndevelopments in the field, allowing us to process written text and interact\\nwith it on a contextual level.\\nMuch like most book s related to LLMs, we begin with the foundation by\\nexploring the details of transformer architecture to understand how these\\nmodels are trained and how to interact with them using prompting techniques.\\nWe then dive into the industry-focused sections, first covering two well-\\nknown frameworks that can be used to leverage these models to create RAG-\\nenabled applications (LlamaIndex and LangChain). This includes a variety of\\nprojects that provide hands-on experience, helping to deeply understand and\\napply these concepts. We also explore advanced techniques, such as using\\nautonomous agents or incorporating vision capabilities to enhance question-\\nanswering. Finally, we explore deployment options for hosting the\\napplication and tips to make the process more efficient.\\nThis book  is designed for readers without prior knowledge of artificial\\nintelligence or NLP. It introduces topics from the ground up, aiming to help\\nyou feel comfortable using the power of AI in your next project or to elevate\\nyour current project to the next level. A basic understanding of Python helps\\ncomprehend the code and implementations, while advanced use cases of the\\ncoding techniques are explained in detail in the book . Each chapter of this\\nbook  introduces a new topic, followed by a real-world project and\\naccompanying implementation (in the form of Google Colab Notebook s) to\\nrun the code and reproduce the results. This hands-on approach helps in\\nunderstanding the concepts and applying them effectively. Here's a brief\\noverview of what to expect in each chapter:\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Building LLMs for Production Louis François Bouchard Louie Peters.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content=\"Chapter I: Introduction to LLMs\\nThe first step in leveraging AI for your project is understanding what's\\nhappening under the hood. While you likely won't need to create your own\\nmodel from scratch and might use proprietary APIs (such as OpenAI)\\ninstead, understanding concepts such as Scaling Laws, Context Windows,\\nEmergent Abilities explain why LLMs are so powerful. The first chapter\\nfocuses on the basic LLM terminology, which is crucial to comprehending the\\nrest of this book  effectively. Additionally, we provide simple examples of\\nusing LLMs for tasks like translation or identifying patterns from data,\\nenabling you to generalize to new and unseen tasks.\\nChapter II: LLM Architectures and Landscape\\nThis chapter will explore different model architectures and their design\\nchoices for different tasks, with a focus on the transformer architecture and\\nits components at each layer, as well as the GPT family of models, which\\npower products like ChatGPT. We cover the training objectives of these\\nmodels, introduce a wide range of models, discuss their usefulness, explore\\ntheir real-world applications, and illustrate how they power different\\nindustries.\\nThis is usually where schools end, and the book  really starts!\\nChapter III: LLMs in Practice\\nIn practice, LLMs still have limitations. Overcoming these limitations to\\nmake them production-ready is why we decided to write the book  in the first\\nplace. This chapter explores several known issues with this family of\\nmodels, such as hallucination, where the model generates factually false\\nresponses with high confidence or biases towards gender or race.

Alongside hallucinations, LLMs sometimes also simply fail to use\\navailable data effectively, leading to irrelevant or incorrect responses.\\nLLMs are generally used in production for performance and productivity-\\nenhancing “copilot” use cases, with a human still fully in the loop rather than\\nfor fully automated tasks due to these limitations. But there is a long journey\\nfrom a basic LLM prompt to sufficient accuracy, reliability, and\\nobservability for a target copilot use case. This journey is called the “march\\nof 9s” and is popu larized in self-driving car development. The term\\ndescribes the gradual improvement in reliability, often measured in the\\nnumber of nines (e.g., 99.9%  reliability) needed to reach human-level\\nperformance eventually.\\nWe think the key developer tool kit for the “march of 9s” for LLM-based\\nproducts is 1) Prompt Engineering, 2) Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n(RAG), 3) Fine-Tuning, and 4) Custom UI/UX.

The primary goal of LLMs is to interpret and create human-\\nlike text that captures the nuances of natural language, including syntax (the\\narrangement of words) and semantics (the meaning of words).\\nThe core training objective of LLMs focuses on predicting the next word in a\\nsentence. This straightforward objective leads to the development of\\nemergent abilities. For example, they can conduct arithmetic calculations,\\nunscramble words, and have even demonstrated proficiency in professional\\nexams, such as passing the US Medical Licensing Exam.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were traditionally used for\\ntext processing due to their ability to process sequential data. They maintain\\nan internal state that retains information from previous words, facilitating\\nsequential understanding. However, RNNs encounter challenges with long\\nsequences where they forget older information in favor of recently processed\\ninput. This is primarily caused by the vanishing gradient problem, a\\nphenomenon where the gradients, which are used to update the network’s\\nweights during training, become increasingly smaller as they are propagated\\nback through each timestep of the sequence. As a result, the weights\\nassociated with early inputs change very little, hindering the network’s\\nability to learn from and remember long-term dependencies within the data.\\nTransformer-based models addressed these challenges and emerged as the\\npreferred architecture for natural language processing tasks. This architecture\\nintroduced in the influential paper “Attention Is All You Need” is a pivotal\\ninnovation in natural language processing. It forms the foundation for cutting-\\nedge models like GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA. The architecture was\\noriginally designed as an encoder-decoder framework. This setting uses an\\nencoder to process input text, identifying important parts and creating a\\nrepresentation of the input. Meanwhile, the decoder is capable of\\ntransforming the encoder’s output, a vector of high dimensionality, back into\\nreadable text for humans. These networks can be useful in tasks such as\\nsummarization, where the decoder generates summaries conditioned based\\non the articles passed to the encoder. It offers additional flexibility across a\\nwide range of tasks since the components of this architecture, the encoder,\\nand decoder, can be used jointly or independently.

However, as you can see from the diagram, several\\nbuilding blocks, like embedding layers and the attention mechanism, are\\nshared on both the encoder and decoder components. Understanding these\\nelements will help improve your understanding of how the models operate\\ninternally. This section outlines the key components and then demonstrates\\nhow to load an open-source model to trace each step.\\nInput Embedding\\nAs we’ve seen in the transformer architecture, the initial step is to turn input\\ntokens (words or subwords) into embeddings. These embeddings are high-\\ndimensional vectors that capture the semantic features of the input tokens.\\nYou can see them as a large list of characteristics representing the words\\nbeing embedded. This list contains thousands of numbers that the model\\nlearns by itself to represent our world. Instead of working with sentences,\\nwords, and synonyms to compare things together, requiring an understanding\\nof our language, it works with these lists of numbers to compare them\\nnumerically with basic calculations, subtracting and adding those vectors\\ntogether to see if they are similar or not. It looks much more complex than\\nunderstanding words themselves, doesn’t it? This is why the size of these\\nembedding vectors is pretty large. When you cannot understand meanings and\\nwords, you need thousands of values representing them. This size varies\\ndepending on the model’s architecture. GPT-3 by OpenAI, for example,\\nemploys 12,000- dimensional embedding vectors, but smaller models such as\\nBERT employ 768-dimensional embeddings. This layer enables the model to\\nunderstand and process the inputs effectively, serving as the foundation for\\nall subsequent layers.\\nPositional Encoding\\nEarlier models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), processed\\ninputs sequentially, one token at a time, naturally preserving the text’s order.\\nUnlike these, transformers do not have built-in sequential processing\\ncapabilities. Instead, they employ positional encodings to maintain the order'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/Building LLMs for Production Louis François Bouchard Louie Peters.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='of words within a phrase for the next layers. These encodings are vectors\\nfilled with unique values at each index, which, when combined with input\\nembeddings, provide the model with data regarding the tokens’ relative or\\nabsolute positions within the sequence. These vectors encode each word’s\\nposition, ensuring that the model identifies word order, which is essential for\\ninterpreting the context and meaning of a sentence.\\nSelf-Attention Mechanism\\nThe self-attention mechanism is at the heart of the transformer model,\\ncalculating a weighted total of the embeddings of all words in a phrase.\\nThese weights are calculated using learned “attention” scores between\\nwords. Higher “attention” weights will be assigned to terms that are more\\nrelevant to one another. Based on the inputs, this is implemented using Query,\\nKey, and Value vectors. Here is a brief description of each vector.\\n• Query Vector: This is the word or token for which the attention\\nweights are calculated. The Query vector specifies which sections of\\nthe input sequence should be prioritized. When you multiply word\\nembeddings by the Query vector, you ask, “What should I pay attention\\nto?”\\n• Key Vector: The set of words or tokens in the input sequence\\ncompared to the Query. The Key vector aids in identifying the\\nimportant or relevant information in the input sequence. When you\\nmultiply word embeddings by the Key vector, you ask yourself, “What\\nis important to consider?”\\n• Value Vector: It stores the information or features associated with\\neach word or token in the input sequence. The Value vector contains\\nthe actual data that will be weighted and mixed in accordance with the\\nattention weights calculated between the Query and Key. The Value\\nvector answers the query, “What information do w e have?”\\nBefore the introduction of the transformer design, the attention mechanism\\nwas mainly used to compare two sections of a text. For example, the model\\ncould focus on different areas of the input article while generating the\\nsummary for a task like summarization.'),\n",

However, a significant subset of currently popu lar LMMs\\nprimarily accept image inputs and can only generate text outputs.\\nThese specialized LMMs frequently use pre-trained large-scale vision or\\nlanguage models as a foundation. They are known as ‘Image-to-Text\\nGenerative Models’ or visual language models (VLMs). They often conduct\\npicture comprehension tasks such as question answering and image'),\n",

The image encoder might be based on Convolutional Neural\\nNetworks (CNNs), for instance, the ResNet, or it could use a transformer-\\nbased architecture, like the Vision Transformer (ViT).\\nThere are two main approaches for training: building the model from scratch\\nor utilizing pre-trained models. The latter is commonly preferred in\\nadvanced models. A notable example is the pre-trained image encoder from\\nOpenAI’s CLIP model. In terms of language models, a wide range of pre-\\ntrained options are available, including Meta’s OPT, LLaMA 2, or Google’s\\nFlanT5, which are instruction-trained.\\nSome models, like BLIP2, incorporate a novel element: a trainable,\\nlightweight connection module that bridges the vision and language\\nmodalities.

The model’s learned patterns determine these scores during training.\\nHowever, the highest probability token isn’t always optimal for the next\\ntoken. Choosing the highest probability token in the first step may lead to a\\nsequence with lower probabilities in subsequent tokens. This results in a low\\noverall joint likelihood. Alternatively, selecting a token with a slightly lower\\nprobability might lead to higher probability tokens in the following steps,\\nachieving a higher joint probability overall. While ideal, calculating\\nprobabilities for all vocabulary tokens over multiple steps is impractical due\\nto computational demands.\\nThe following decoding methods aim to find a balance between:\\n• Being “greedy” by immediately choosing the token with the highest\\nprobability.\\n• Allowing for some exploration by predicting multiple tokens\\nsimultaneously to enhance overall coherence and context relevance.\\nGreedy Search\\nGreedy Search is the most basic decoding approach, where the model always\\nchooses the highest probability token as the next output. Greedy Search is\\ncomputationally efficient but tends to yield repetitive or suboptimal\\nresponses. This is because it prioritizes the immediate, most probable token\\nover the overall quality of the output in the long run.\\nSampling\\nSampling introduces an element of randomness in text generation.

This approach can lead to more varied and diverse outputs.\\nHowever, it may sometimes produce less coherent or logical text, as the\\nselection is not solely based on the highest probabilities.\\nBeam Search\\nBeam Search is a more advanced decoding strategy. It involves choosing the\\ntop N candidates (where N is a predefined parameter) with the highest\\nprobabilities for the next token at each step, but only for a limited number of\\nsteps. Eventually, the model generates the sequence (i.e., the beam) with the\\nhighest overall joint probability.\\nThis method narrows the search space, often leading to more coherent\\nresults. Beam Search can be slow and may not always produce the best\\noutput. It could miss high-probability words when preceded by a lower-\\nprobability word.\\nTop-K Sampling\\nThe Top-K Sampling is a technique in which the model limits its selection\\npool to the top K most probable words (with K being a parameter). This\\nmethod creates diversity in the text, ensures relevance by reducing the range\\nof choices, and provides enhanced control over the output.\\nTop-p (Nucleus) Sampling\\nThe Top-p or Nucleus Sampling chooses words from the smallest group of\\ntokens whose combined probability surpasses a specified threshold P (with\\nP being a parameter). This technique allows precise output control by\\nexcluding rare or unlikely tokens.

As a result, the model is more likely to select the most\\nprobable word, resulting in more accurate and conservative\\noutputs with a greater probability but less diversity.\\n– Temperature = 1: There is no scaling of logits when the\\ntemperature is set to 1, preserving the underlying probability\\ndistribution.

Chain of Thought Prompting\\nChain of Thought Prompting (CoT) is a method designed to prompt Large\\nLanguage Models to articulate their thought process, enhancing the accuracy\\nof the results. This technique involves presenting examples that showcase the\\nreasoning process, guiding the LLM to explain its logic while responding to\\nprompts. CoT has proven beneficial for arithmetic, common-sense reasoning,\\nand symbolic thinking tasks.\\nIn the context of LangChain, CoT offers several advantages. Firstly, it\\nsimplifies complex tasks by enabling the LLM to break down challenging\\nproblems into more manageable steps. This feature is valuable for tasks\\nrequiring calculations, logical analysis, or multi-step reasoning. Secondly,\\nCoT can guide the model through a series of related prompts, fostering more\\ncoherent and contextually appropriate outputs. This can result in more\\nprecise and practical responses, especially in tasks requiring a thorough\\nunderstanding of the problem or subject matter.\\nHowever, there are limitations to CoT that should be considered. One\\nlimitation is that it is effective primarily with models with around 100 bi llion\\nparameters or more. Smaller models often produce nonsensical thought\\nprocesses, reducing accuracy compared to traditional prompting methods.'),\n",

However, other\\noptions are also available for less complex tasks.\\nNote: The thesaurus application will serve as a practical example to\\nclarify the nuanc es of each appr oach.\\n1-1.

It’s mandatory to provide a brief description using\\nthe Field function’s description attribute, aiding the model during\\ninference.

Validators: We can declare functions to validate the formatting.\\nFor instance, the provided code has a validation to ensure the first\\ncharacter is not a number.

Nearest\\nneighbor search is applied in various functions, including de-duplication,\\nrecommendation systems, anomaly detection, and reverse image searching.\\nSimilarity Search and Vector Embeddings\\nOpenAI’s models are versatile, and some can generate embeddings that we\\ncan use for similarity searches. In this section, we will use the OpenAI API\\nto create embeddings from a collection of documents and then perform a\\nsimilarity search using cosine similarity.\\nTo begin, install the necessary packages using the command:\\npip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai==0.27.8 tiktoken scikit-\\nlearn.\\nNext, set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\\nNow, let’s generate embeddings for our documents and perform a similarity\\nsearch:'),\n",

The query string contains\\nthe text for which we want to find the most similar document.\\nAfter obtaining the embeddings for our documents and the query, calculate\\nthe cosine similarity between the query embedding and each document\\nembedding. Cosine similarity is a widely used distance metric to assess the\\nsimilarity between two vectors. In our context, it provides a series of\\nsimilarity scores, each indicating how similar the query is to each document.\\nOnce we have these similarity scores, we identify the document that is most\\nsimilar to the query. This is achieved by finding the index of the highest\\nsimilarity score and then retrieving the corresponding document from our\\ncollection.\\nOpen-source Embedding Models\\nEmbedding models belong to a specific category of machine learning models\\ndesigned to transform discrete data points into continuous vector\\nrepresentations. In natural language processing, these discrete elements can\\nbe words, sentences, or entire documents. The resulting vector\\nrepresentations, referred to as embeddings, aim to encapsulate the semantic\\nessence of the original data.\\nFor instance, words with similar meanings, such as ‘cat’ and ‘kitten,’ are\\nlikely to have closely aligned embeddings. These embeddings possess high\\ndimensionality and are utilized to capture subtle semantic differences.\\nOne key advantage of using embeddings is their ability to enable\\nmathematical operations for interpreting semantic meanings. As illustrated, a\\ncommon application involves calculating the cosine similarity between two\\nembeddings to assess the semantic closeness of associated words or\\ndocuments.\\nHere is another example using an open-source embedding model:\\nWe chose “sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2”, a pre-trained model\\nfor converting sentences into semantically meaningful vectors.'),\n",

LlamaIndex enriches your toolkit, providing\\nan additional resource for tackling real-world problems. Let’s look at the\\nmain components of the LlamaIndex library.\\nQuerying in LlamaIndex\\nThe querying process in LlamaIndex involves several key elements:\\n• Retrievers: These classes fetch a collection of nodes from an index\\nin response to a query. They are responsible for sourcing the relevant\\ndata from the indexes.\\n• Query Engine: This core class processes a query and delivers a\\nresponse object. The Query Engine compiles the final output using both\\nthe retrievers and response synthesizer modules.\\n• Query Transform: This class is used to refine a raw query string\\nthrough various transformations, enhancing the efficiency of the\\nretrieval process.

This involves converting\\nquestions into vector formats for unstructured data, enabling comparison with\\nvector representations of source documents to identify the most relevant\\nchunks. It is also applicable to structured data, such as databases, where\\nqueries are formulated in languages like SQL for effective data retrieval.'),\n",

For instance, a query like “movies about aliens in the year 1980”\\ncombines a semantic element like “aliens” (better retrieved through vector\\nstorage) with a structured element like “year == 1980” . The process includes\\ntranslating a natural language query into the specific query language of a\\ndatabase, whether it’s SQL for relational databases or Cypher for graph\\ndatabases.\\nThe implementation of query construction varies based on the use case. One\\napproach involves MetadataFilter classes for vector stores, incorporating\\nmetadata filtering and an auto-retriever that converts natural language into\\nunstructured queries. This requires defining the source, interpreting the user\\nprompt, extracting conditions, and forming a request. Another approach is\\ntext-to-SQL for relational databases, where converting natural language\\ninto SQL requests faces challenges such as hallucination (creating non-\\nexistent tables or fields) and user errors (mis-spellings or inconsistencies).\\nThis is managed by providing the LLM with an accurate database schema and\\nusing few-shot examples to guide the query generation.\\nQuery Construction enhances the quality of answers produced by RAG by\\ninferring logical filter conditions directly from user questions. The retrieved\\ntexts are refined before being passed to the LLM for the final answer\\nsynthesis.\\n💡 Query Construction is a process that translates natural language queries\\ninto structured or unstructured database queries, enhancing the accuracy of\\ndata retrieval.\\nQuery Expansion\\nQuery expansion enhances the original query by adding related terms or\\nsynonyms. This technique is beneficial when the initial query is too specific\\nor uses specialized terminology. By incorporating broader or more\\ncommonly used terms relevant to the subject, query expansion broadens the\\nsearch’s scope.

Here are the key elements required in this process:\\n• Query Engine: The Query Engine’s performance is the key\\ncomponent assessed during the evaluation.\\n• Metrics: Ragas offers a variety of metrics tailored for a detailed\\nassessment of the engine’s capabilities.\\n• Questions: A carefully selected set of questions to test the engine’s\\nproficiency in retrieving and generating accurate responses.\\nThe first step to using the Ragas library is setting up a query engine. This\\nprocess involves loading a document. We will use the “New York City”\\nWikipedia page as the source document in this case.

This also includes tracking the general\\norigin of the data, whether it’s from a specific book , documentation, or a\\nblog. For example, the Towards AI RAG AI tutor uses five data sources:\\nTowards AI blogs, Activeloop documentation, LlamaIndex documentation,\"),\n",

As the dataset\\nexpands, new data points are added to these existing sources or incorporated\\ninto new ones. Implementing this approach from the beginning enhances the\\nchatbot’s efficiency by directing the “routers” to focus on the relevant\\ninformation source.\\nSelecting suitable datasets is important to developing a data-driven\\napplication with the LlamaIndex RAG system. The data’s quality and\\nrelevance significantly impact the system’s performance, whether stored\\nlocally or hosted online in a vector store database like Deep Lake. Online\\ntools like Deep Lake offer built-in features for easy visualization, querying,\\ntracking, and data management.\\nIt is better to begin the RAG pipeline design with a manageable dataset, such\\nas web articles. A foundational data environment that is manageable and rich\\nis key to a successful start. It allows efficient testing, debugging, and\\nunderstanding of the RAG system and enables easy querying and evaluating\\nresponses on a controlled and familiar dataset.\\nFor this example, we will focus on Nikola Tesla’s life, work, and legacy,\\nwith detailed information about his innovations, personal history, and\\ninfluence. We will use two text documents: one with bold predictions Tesla\\nmade during his lifetime and another with biographical details. We will\\nimport these files and set up the indexes by combining data sources from the\\nDeep Lake vector store for the first document and creating indexes from local\\nstorage for the second one.\\nDownload the documents using the wget command.

For example, a pre-trained LLM might\\ngenerate coherent text yet struggle with summarizing a web page or\\ngenerating SQL queries. Fine-tuning addresses these limitations.\\nFine-tuning resumes training a pre-trained model to increase the performance\\nof a specific task using task-specific data. This allows the model to adjust its\\ninternal parameters and representations to better suit the task, thus improving\\nits ability to tackle dom ain-specific issues.\\nHowever, standard fine-tuning for LLMs can be resource-heavy and\\nexpensive. It requires modifying all parameters in the pre-trained models,\\noften in billions. Therefore, using more efficient and cost-effective fine-\\ntuning techniques, such as LoRA, is essential.\\nInstruction Fine-Tuning\\nInstruction fine-tuning is a strategy popu larized by OpenAI in 2022 with their\\nInstructGPT models.

It optimizes the language model directly using binary cross-\\nentropy loss, avoiding the need for a separate reward model and the\\ncomplexities of reinforcement learning-based optimization. This is achieved\\nthrough an analytical conversion of the reward function into the optimal RL\\npolicy. The optimal RL policy transforms the RL loss, which typically\\nincorporates the reward and reference models, into a loss over just the\\nreference model.\\nAs a result, DPO simplifies the fine-tuning process by removing the need for\\ncomplicated RL approaches or a reward model.\\nReinforced Self-Training\\nGoogle DeepMind’s Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) is a more cost-\\nefficient approach than RLHF. The ReST algorithm functions through a\\nrepetitive cycle of two primary phases.\\n1. The initial phase, the ‘Grow’ phase, uses a language to generate\\nvarious output predictions for each context. These predictions are\\nused to expand a training dataset.\\n2. The next phase, the ‘Improve’ phase, ranks and filters the\\nexpanded dataset.

The primary\\nobjective is to develop a smaller and more efficient model while retaining as\\nmuch accuracy as possible. Downsizing the model has several advantages,\\nincluding quicker inference times, a smaller memory footprint, and enhanced\\nenergy efficiency.\\nPruned models are leaner and require fewer computational resources during\\nthe inference phase.

Some of the commonly used methods include:\\nMagnitude-based Pruning (or Unstructured\\nPruning)\\nMagnitude-based or unstructured pruning removes weights or activations of\\nsmall magnitudes in a model. The underlying principle is that smaller\\nweights have a lesser impact on the model’s overall performance and can\\nthus be eliminated without significant loss of functionality.\\nThe concept was elaborately presented in the paper “Network Trimming: A\\nData-Driven Neuron Pruning Approach towards Efficient Deep\\nArchitectures.” It introduced an optimization technique for deep neural'),\n",

As we\\nhave seen earlier in Figure 1.6, these models are competent text completion\\nmodels and can carry out other tasks such as spelling correction,\\nclassification, or language translation. This is actually very remarkable given\\nthat GPT models are pretrained on a relatively simple next-word prediction\\ntask, as illustrated in Figure 1.7.\\nFigure 1.7 In the next-word pretraining task for GPT models, the system learns to predict the\\nupcoming word in a sentence by looking at the words that have come before it. This approach\\nhelps the model understand how words and phrases typically fit together in language, forming a\\nfoundation that can be applied to various other tasks.\\nThe next-word prediction task is a form of self-supervised learning, which is\\na form of self-labeling. This means that we don\\'t need to collect labels for the\\ntraining data explicitly but can leverage the structure of the data itself: we can\\nuse the next word in a sentence or document as the label that the model is\\nsupposed to predict. Since this next-word prediction task allows us to create\\nlabels \"on the fly,\" it is possible to leverage massive unlabeled text datasets to\\ntrain LLMs as previously discussed in section \\n1.5, Utilizing large datasets\\n.\\nCompared to the original transformer architecture we covered in section 1.4,\\nUsing LLMs for different tasks\\n, the general GPT architecture is relatively\\nsimple. Essentially, it\\'s just the decoder part without the encoder as illustrated\\nin Figure 1.8. Since decoder-style models like GPT generate text by\\npredicting text one word at a time, they are considered a type of\\nautoregressive\\n model. Autoregressive models incorporate their previous\\noutputs as inputs for future predictions. Consequently, in GPT, each new\\nword is chosen based on the sequence that precedes it, which improves\\ncoherence of the resulting text.'),\n",

In other words, tensors are\\nmathematical objects that can be characterized by their order (or rank), which\\nprovides the number of dimensions.

A scalar is a 0-dimensional tensor (for instance, just a number), a\\nvector is a 1-dimensional tensor, and a matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor.\\nThere is no specific term for higher-dimensional tensors, so we typically refer\\nto a 3-dimensional tensor as just a 3D tensor, and so forth.\\nWe can create objects of PyTorch's \\nTensor\\n class using the \\ntorch.tensor\\nfunction as follows:\\nListing A.1 Creating PyTorch tensors\\nimport torch\\n \\n \\ntensor0d = torch.tensor(1) #A\\n \\n \\ntensor1d = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]) #B\"),\n",

The\\noverall idea behind data loading in PyTorch is illustrated in figure A.10.\\nFigure A.10 PyTorch implements a Dataset and a DataLoader class. The Dataset class is used to\\ninstantiate objects that define how each data record is loaded. The DataLoader handles how the\\ndata is shuffled and assembled into batches.\\nFollowing the illustration in figure A.10, in this section, we will implement a\\ncustom Dataset class that we will use to create a training and a test dataset\\nthat we'll then use to create the data loaders.\\nLet's start by creating a simple toy dataset of five training examples with two\\nfeatures each.

DDP enables\\nparallelism by splitting the input data across the available devices and\\nprocessing these data subsets simultaneously.\\nHow does this work? PyTorch launches a separate process on each GPU, and\\neach process receives and keeps a copy of the model -- these copies will be\\nsynchronized during training. To illustrate this, suppose we have two GPUs\\nthat we want to use to train a neural network, as shown in figure A.12.\\nFigure A.12 The model and data transfer in DDP involves two key steps. First, we create a copy\\nof the model on each of the GPUs. Then we divide the input data into unique minibatches that we\\npass on to each model copy.\\nEach of the two GPUs will receive a copy of the model. Then, in every\\ntraining iteration, each model will receive a minibatch (or just batch) from the\\ndata loader.

These gradients are then averaged and\\nsynchronized during training to update the models. This way, we ensure that\\nthe models don't diverge, as illustrated in figure A.13.\\nFigure A.13 The forward and backward pass in DDP are executed independently on each GPU\\nwith its corresponding data subset. Once the forward and backward passes are completed,\\ngradients from each model replica (on each GPU) are synchronized across all GPUs. This ensures\\nthat every model replica has the same updated weights.\\nThe benefit of using DDP is the enhanced speed it offers for processing the\\ndataset compared to a single GPU. Barring a minor communication overhead\\nbetween devices that comes with DDP use, it can theoretically process a\\ntraining epoch in half the time with two GPUs compared to just one. The time\\nefficiency scales up with the number of GPUs, allowing us to process an\\nepoch eight times faster if we have eight GPUs, and so on.\\nMulti-GPU computing in interactive environments\\nDDP does not function properly within interactive Python environments like\\nJupyter notebooks, which don't handle multiprocessing in the same way a\\nstandalone Python script does. Therefore, the following code should be\\nexecuted as a script, not within a notebook interface like Jupyter. This is\\nbecause DDP needs to spawn multiple processes, and each process should\\nhave its own Python interpreter instance.\\nLet's now see how this works in practice.

For example, instead of loading the 1558M\\ninstead of 124M model in chapter 5, the only 2 lines of code that we have to\\nchange are the following:\\nhparams, params = download_and_load_gpt2(model_size=\"124M\", models_dir=\"gpt2\")\\nmodel_name = \"gpt2-small (124M)\"\\nThe updated code is as follows:\\nhparams, params = download_and_load_gpt2(model_size=\"1558M\", models_dir=\"gpt2\")\\nmodel_name = \"gpt2-xl (1558M)\"'),\n",
